'''Assignment: Track your investments
Write a script invest.py that will track the growing amount of an investment over time.
This script includes an invest() function that takes three inputs: the initial investment
amount, the annual compounding rate, and the total number of years to invest. So, the
first line of the function will look like this:
def invest(amount, rate, time):
The function then prints out the amount of the investment for every year of the time
period.
In the main body of the script (after defining the function), use the following code to test
your function:
invest(100, .05, 8)
invest(2000, .025, 5)'''

def invest(amount, rate, time):
    print('principal amount: ', amount)
    print('annual rate of return: ', rate)
    for year in range(1,int(time) + 1):
        balance = amount*(1+rate)
        print('year ', year, ': $', float(balance))
        amount = balance
invest(100, 0.05, 8)  
invest(2000, 0.025, 5)
