'''Review exercises:
1. Create a tuple named cardinal_nums that holds the strings "first", "second" and
"third" in order
2. Display the string at position 2 in cardinal_nums by using an index number
3. Copy the tuple values into three new strings named pos1 , pos2 and pos3 in a
single line of code by using tuple unpacking, then print those string values'''

cardinal_nums = 'first', 'secound', 'third' # touple packing
print(cardinal_nums[1])
pos1, pos2, pos3 = cardinal_nums # touple unpacking
print(pos1, pos2, pos3)
