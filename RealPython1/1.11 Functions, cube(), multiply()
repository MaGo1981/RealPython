'''
1. Write a cube() function that takes a number and multiplies that number by itself
twice over, returning the new value; test the function by displaying the result of
calling your cube() function on a few different numbers
2. Write a function multiply() that takes two numbers as inputs and multiplies them
together, returning the result; test your function by saving the result of multiply(2,
5) in a new variable and printing it
