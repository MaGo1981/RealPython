Assignment: Use pattern matching to delete
files
Write a script remove_files.py that will look in the chapter 9 practice files folder named
"little pics" as well all of its subfolders. The script should use os.remove() to delete any
JPG file found in any of these folders if the file is less than 2 Kb (2,000 bytes) in size.
You can supply the os.path.getsize() function with a full file path to return the file's
size in bytes. Check the contents of the folders before running your script to make sure
that you delete the correct files; you should only end up removing the files named "to be
deleted.jpg" and "definitely has to go.jpg" - although you should only use the file
extensions and file sizes to determine this.
If you mess up and delete the wrong files, there is a folder named "backup" that contains
an exact copy of the "little pics" folder and all its contents so that you can copy these
contents back and try again.

        # check if size is less than 2Kb
        check_size = os.path.getsize(full_path) < 2000
        if check_JPG and check_size:  # both conditions must be True

            os.remove(full_path)
