'''Review exercises:
1. Display the full paths of all of the files and folders in the images folder 
by using os.listdir()
2. Display the full paths of any PNG files in the images folder by using glob.glob()
3. Rename any PNG files in the images folder and its subfolders to be JPG files by
using os.walk() ; in case you mess things up beyond repair, there is a copy of the
images folder in the backup folder
4. Make sure that your last script worked by using os.path.exists() to check that the
JPG files now exist (by providing os.path.exists() with the full path to each of
these files)'''
