'''Review exercises:
1. Use a break statement to write a script that prompts the users 
for input repeatedly, only ending when the user types "q" or "Q" 
to quit the program; a common way of creating an infinite loop is to 
write while True: .
2. Combine a for loop over a range() of numbers with the continue keyword
to print every number from 1 through 50 except for multiples of 3; 
you will need to use the % operator.'''

question = None
while question != "q" and question !="Q":
        question = input('What is your name?')
