'''Review exercises:
1. Write a for loop that prints out the integers 2 through 10, each on a new line, by
using the range() function
2. Use a while loop that prints out the integers 2 through 10 (Hint: you'll need to
create a new integer first; there isn't a good reason to use a while loop instead of a
for loop in this case, but it's good practice...)
3. Write a function called doubles() that takes one number as its input and doubles
that number three times using a loop, displaying each result on a separate line; test
your function by calling doubles(2) to display 4, 8, and 16'''

#1
for num in range(2,11):
    print(num)
    
#2
number = 2
while number < 11:
    print(number)
    number = number + 1
 
 #3
def doubles(broj):
    for num in range(3):
        broj += broj
        print(broj)
doubles(2)
