'''Review exercises:
1. Read in the raw text file poem.txt from the chapter 10 practice files and display each
line by looping over them individually, then close the file; we'll discuss using file
paths in the next section, but for now you can save your script in the same folder as
the text file
2. Repeat the previous exercise using the with keyword so that the file is closed
automatically after you're done looping through the lines
3. Write a text file output.txt that contains the same lines as poem.txt by opening both
files at the same time (in different modes) and copying the original file over line-byline;
do this using a loop and closing both files, then repeat this exercise using the
with keyword
4. Re-open output.txt and append an additional line of your choice to the end of the file
on a new line'''
