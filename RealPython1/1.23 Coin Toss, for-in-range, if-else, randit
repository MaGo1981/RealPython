'''Assignment: Simulate a coin toss experiment

Write a script coin_toss.py that uses coin toss simulations to 
determine the answer to
this slightly more complex probability puzzle:
I keep flipping a fair coin until I've seen it land on both heads and 
tails at least once each
- in other words, after I flip the coin the first time, I continue to 
flip it until I get a different
result. On average, how many times will I have to flip the coin total? 
Again, the actual
probability could be worked out, but the point here is to simulate the 
event using
randint() . To get the expected average number of tosses, you should 
set a variable
trials = 10000 and a variable flips = 0 , then add 1 to your flips 
variable every
time a coin toss is made. Then you can print flips / trials at the end 
of the code to
see what the average number of flips was.
This one is tricky to structure correctly. Try writing out the logic 
before you start coding.
Some additional pointers if you're stuck:
1. You will need to use a for loop over a range of trials.
2. For each trial, first you should check the outcome of the first flip.
3. Make sure you add the first flip to the total number of flips.
4. After the first toss, you'll need another loop to keep flipping while 
you get the same
result as the first flip.

from random import randint

flips = 0
trials = 10

for trial in range(0, trials):
    flips += 1  # first flip
    if randint(0, 1) == 0:  # flipped tails on first flip
        while randint(0, 1) == 0:  # keep flipping tails
            flips += 1
        flips += 1  # finally flipped heads
    else:  # otherwise, flipped heads on first flip
        while randint(0, 1) == 1:  # keep flipping heads
            flips += 1
        flips += 1  # finally flipped tails

print(flips / trials)
