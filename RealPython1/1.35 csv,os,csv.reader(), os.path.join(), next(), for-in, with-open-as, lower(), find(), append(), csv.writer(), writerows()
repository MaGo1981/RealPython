Review exercises:
1. Write a script that reads in the data from the CSV file pastimes.csv located in the
chapter 9 practice files folder, skipping over the header row
2. Display each row of data (except for the header row) as a list of strings
3. Add code to your script to determine whether or not the second entry in each row
(the "Favorite Pastime") converted to lower-case includes the word "fighting" using
the string methods find() and lower()
4. Use the list append() method to add a third column of data to each row that takes
the value "Combat" if the word "fighting" is found and takes the value "Other" if
neither word appears
5. Write out a new CSV file categorized pastimes.csv to the Output folder with the
updated data that includes a new header row with the fields "Name", "Favorite
Pastime", and "Type of Pastime"
