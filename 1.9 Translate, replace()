'''Assignment: Turn your user into a l33t h4x0r
Write a script translate.py that asks the user for some input with the following prompt:
Enter some text:
You should then use the replace() method to convert the text entered by the user into
"leetspeak" by making the following changes to lower-case letters:
The letter: a becomes: 4
The letter: b becomes: 8
The letter: e becomes: 3
The letter: l becomes: 1
The letter: o becomes: 0
The letter: s becomes: 5
The letter: t becomes: 7
Your program should then display the resulting output. A sample run of the program,
with the user input in bold, is shown below:
>>> Enter some text: I like to eat eggs and spam.
I 1ik3 70 347 3gg5 4nd 5p4m.'''

text = Input('Enter some text: ')
text = text.replace("a", "4")
text = text.replace("b", "8")
text = text.replace("e", "3")
text = text.replace("l", "1")
text = text.replace("o", "0")
text = text.replace("s", "5")
text = text.replace("t", "7")
print(text)
